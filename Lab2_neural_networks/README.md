# Neural networks

## Task
    1. Build a neural network from a single neuron and train it on the datasets nn_0.csv and nn_1.csv. How different is the learning outcome and why? How many epochs did it take to learn? Try different activation functions and optimizers.
    2. Modify the neural network from point 1 so as to achieve the minimum error on the dataset nn_1.csv. Why were such changes made?
    3. Create a classifier based on a neural network for the MNIST dataset (you can also download it using torchvision.datasets.MNIST, tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data, etc.). Evaluate the quality of the classification.
