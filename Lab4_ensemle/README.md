# Ensemble methods

## Task
    1. Investigate the dependence of classification quality on the number of classifiers in the ensemble for bagging algorithms on the glass.csv dataset with various basic classifiers. Plot graphs of the classification quality dependence with a different number of classifiers, explain the results obtained.
    2. Investigate the dependence of classification quality on the number of classifiers in the ensemble for the boosting algorithm (for example, AdaBoost) on the vehicle.csv dataset with various basic classifiers. Plot graphs of the classification quality dependence for a different number of classifiers, explain the results obtained.
    3. Build a meta-classifier for the titanic_train.csv dataset using stacking and evaluate the classification quality on titanic_train.csv
