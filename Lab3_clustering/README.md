# Clustering

## Task
    1. Split the set of objects from the pluto.csv dataset into 3 clusters using k-means. Compare the quality of the partition depending on the maximum number of iterations of the algorithm and the use of standardization.
    2. Cluster many objects from the clustering_1.csv, clustering_2.csv, and clustering_3.csv datasets using k-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering. Determine the optimal number of clusters (where applicable). Which method worked better and why?
    3. Compress the color palette of the image (any one of your choice). To do this, select n clusters from the colors of all pixels in the image and fix the centers of these clusters. Create an image with colors from a reduced palette (pixel colors only from the centers of the selected clusters). Show the original and compressed images.
    4. Build a dendrogram for the votes.csv dataset (the number of votes cast for Republicans in the elections from 1856 to 1976). The rows represent 50 states and the columns represent election years (31). Interpret the result.
